## Databases
Descriptions of the databases used in glados

## Overview

- Tables are defined in migration files (`./migration/src/m*.rs`). Tables are Enums a Migration::up() uses to manage the tables.
- sea_orm uses to migration files to generate `entities` that can be found in `./entities/src/*.rs`, one file per table.
- Entities exist as `Model` structs, whose members are columns in the table.

## Terminology

- Content key
    - A way to refer to a specific element.
    - Based on an existing unique identifier, such as a block hash or transaction hash.
    - Is combined with a selector, allowing two elements from the same block to have different
    content keys. (e.g., body and receipts, which otherwise have the same block hash).
    - See [spec](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/blob/master/history-network.md#data-types).
- Content id
    - An identifier that is useful in coordinating content in the network.
    - Derived by hashing the content key.
    - See [spec](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/blob/master/portal-wire-protocol.md#content-keys-and-content-ids).
- History data.
    - Each of these is referred to using a content key, and coordinated via content ids.
    - Glados doesn't store everything, only the content keys, content ids and a
    blocknumber/blockhash to make content keys understable.
    - Components
        - Header
            - Everything in a block except the body and receipts.
        - Body
            - Transactions and uncles
        - Receipts
            - Transaction receipts (different from transactions)
- Audit
    - The main function of glados.
    - Consists of a content key, a pass/fail and a timestamp.
    - Steps:
        1. Record what the portal network should have (`glados-monitor`)
        2. Pick something (a content key), and check the portal network for it (`glados-audit`)
        3. Record a pass/fail and timestamp for that thing.
        4. Display that (`glados-web`), e.g., the content key "`x`" (which may represent "block `y`
        receipts") was not present in the portal network at timestamp `z`.
